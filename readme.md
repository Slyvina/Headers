# Slyvina Headers

This repository are merely a copy of all header files. 
This copy is fully automated and should NOT be edited manually.
No issues should be posted on this repository and pull requests will be ignored.
Please put those in the proper repository.

The purpose of this repository is merely to make configuring compilers easier. Only one include directory.
That's all this repository is about. Nothing more, nothing less.


# IMPORTANT NOTE!

This repository is NOT updated daily. It *is* therefore possible some header files are outdated.
Always keep that in mind when compiling my stuff.
